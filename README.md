Fun with the Fizzbuzz challenge

I wanted to have more fun with Fizzbuzz than console.log. It's a work in progress as I come back to add more fun things. 

I added:
  - pics to represent "Fizz", "Buzz", and "Fizzbuzz"
  - results print to the screen not the console
    
Next planned additions: 
  - thumbnails of each pic next to the on screen text result
  - hover effect for text
  - tidy the whole thing with more styling
  - ???
